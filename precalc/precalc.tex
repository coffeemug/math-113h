\title{A Lazy Precalculus Refresher}
\author{Slava Akhmechet}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

As I'm working through Spivak Calculus I'm discovering there is a ton
of high school math I've forgotten (or simply never learned). The
purpose of these notes is to relearn the necessary prerequisites as
quickly as possible.

\vs

For these notes I pull in material ``lazily''. There is no predefined
set of topics; nothing that ``should'' or ``shouldn't'' be a part of
precalculus. I don't want to go through a 500 page book or take a year
long class, so when I need to know something to get through Spivak's
chapter but don't already know it, it goes into these notes.

\vs

When I do need to (re-)learn a topic, I'm mostly pulling material from
``Paul's Online Notes'' excellent
\href{https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Extras/AlgebraTrigReview/AlgebraTrig.aspx}{Algebra
  Trig Review}. He definitely nails the topic list-- the stuff his
calculus students forgot (or never learned) lines up really well with
what I need.
