\subsection*{Problem 2}
Find $f'(x)$.

\vs

(i) $f(x)=\sin((x+1)^2(x+2))$

\[f'(x)=\cos((x+1)^2(x+2))\cdot(2(x+1)(x+2)+(x+1)^2)\]

\vs

(iv) $f(x)=\sin\left(\frac{x^3}{\cos x^3}\right)$

\[\cos\left(\frac{x^3}{\cos x^3}\right)\cdot \frac{3x^2(\cos x^3+x^3\cdot \sin
    x^3)}{\cos^2 x^3}\]


\subsection*{Problem 4}
Find $f'(f(x))$ (\textit{not} $(f\circ f)'(x)$).

\vs

(i) $f(x)=\frac{1}{1+x}$

\[f'(x)=-\frac{1}{(1+x)^2}\]

Thus
\[f'(f(x))=-\frac{1}{(1+\frac{1}{1+x})^2}=-\left(\frac{1+x}{2+x}\right)^2\]

\subsection*{Problem 6}
Find $f'$ in therms of $g'$ if

\vs

(iii) $f(x)=g(x+g(x))$

\[f'(x)=g'(x+g(x))\cdot (1+g'(x))\]

\subsection*{Problem 8}
The area between two varying concentric circles is at all times $9\pi$
in$^{2}$. The rate of change of the area of the larger circle is
$10\pi$ in$^2/\sec$. How fast is the circumference of the smaller circle
changing when it has area of $16\pi$ in$^2$?

\subsection*{Problem 9}
Particle $A$ moves along the positive horizontal axis, and particle
$B$ along the graph of $f(x)=-\sqrt{3}x,x\leq0$. At a certain time,
$A$ is at the point $(5,0)$ and moving with speed $3$ units/sec; and
$B$ is at a distance of 3 units from the origin and moving with speed
$4$ units/sec. At what rate is the distance between $A$ and $B$
changing?
