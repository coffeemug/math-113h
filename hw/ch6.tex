\section{Continuity}
\subsection*{Problem 1}
For which of the following functions $f$ is there a continuous function $F$ with domain $\R$ such that $F(x)=f(x)$ for all $x$ in the domain of $f$?

\subsubsection*{Solution}
(i) $f(x)=\frac{x^2-4}{x-2}$
\[\frac{x^2-4}{x-2}=\frac{(x-2)(x+2)}{(x-2)}=x+2\]
when $x\neq 2$. Thus let $F(x)=x+2$. It follows $F(x)=f(x)$ for all $x$ in the domain of $f$, as $2$ is not in the domain of $f$. Further, $F$ is continuous in $R$ as
\[\lim_{x\to a}x+2=a+2\]

(ii) $f(x)=\frac{|x|}{x}$

There is no such function $F$. Observe that if we define $F$ such that $F(x)=f(x)$ for all $x$ in the domain of $f$, the only point we have left to manipulate is $0$. It's easy to see that no definition of $F(0)$ will allow $F$ to have a limit at $0$, and thus $F$ cannot be continuous.

\subsection*{Problem 5}
For each number $a$, find a function which is continuous at $a$, but not at any other points.

\subsubsection*{Solution}

\subsection*{Problem 8}
Suppose that $f$ is continuous at $a$ and $f(a)=0$. Prove that if $\alpha\neq 0$, then $f+\alpha$ is nonzero in some open interval containing $a$.
