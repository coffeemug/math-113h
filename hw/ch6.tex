\section{Continuity}
\subsection*{Problem 1}
For which of the following functions $f$ is there a continuous function $F$ with domain $\R$ such that $F(x)=f(x)$ for all $x$ in the domain of $f$?

\subsubsection*{Solution}
(i) $f(x)=\frac{x^2-4}{x-2}$
\[\frac{x^2-4}{x-2}=\frac{(x-2)(x+2)}{(x-2)}=x+2\]
when $x\neq 2$. Thus let $F(x)=x+2$. It follows $F(x)=f(x)$ for all $x$ in the domain of $f$, as $2$ is not in the domain of $f$. Further, $F$ is continuous in $R$ as
\[\lim_{x\to a}x+2=a+2\]

(ii) $f(x)=\frac{|x|}{x}$

There is no such function $F$. Observe that if we define $F$ such that $F(x)=f(x)$ for all $x$ in the domain of $f$, the only point we have left to manipulate is $0$. It's easy to see that no definition of $F(0)$ will allow $F$ to have a limit at $0$, and thus $F$ cannot be continuous.

\subsection*{Problem 5}
For each number $a$, find a function which is continuous at $a$, but not at any other points.

\subsubsection*{Solution}
As per textbook, the following modification of the Dirichlet function
is continuous at $0$ but nowhere else:
\[
f(x) = 
\begin{cases} 
x & \text{for rational } x,\\
0 & \text{for irrational } x.
\end{cases}
\]

Shifting horizontally by $a$ creates a function continous at $a$ but
nowhere else:
\[
g(x) = 
\begin{cases} 
x-a & \text{for rational } x,\\
0 & \text{for irrational } x.
\end{cases}
\]


\subsection*{Problem 8}
Suppose that $f$ is continuous at $a$ and $f(a)=0$. Prove that if $\alpha\neq 0$, then $f+\alpha$ is nonzero in some open interval containing $a$.

\subsubsection*{Solution}
Since $f$ is continous at $a$, by continuity theorems (addition of
identity and constant functions) $f+\alpha$ is also continuous. Also
$(f+\alpha)(a)=\alpha$, and thus $\lim_{x\to a}(f+\alpha)(x)=\alpha$. We can set
$\epsilon=\alpha$, and by limit definition there exists an interval in which
$|(f+\alpha)(x)-\alpha|<\alpha$. In another words within the interval $f+\alpha$ is less
than $\alpha$ away from $\alpha$, and thus cannot be zero.
