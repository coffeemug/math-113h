\section{Least Upper Bounds}

\subsection*{Problem 3a}
Let $f$ be a continous function on $[a, b]$ with $f(a)<0<f(b)$. The
proof of Theorem 1 showed that there is a smallest $x$ in $[a,b]$ with
$f(x)=0$. Is there necessarily a second smallest $x$ in $[a,b]$ with
$f(x)=0$? Show that there is a largest $x$ in $[a,b]$ with $f(x)=0$.
(Try to give an easy proof by considering a new function closely
related to $f$.)

\subsubsection*{Solution}

\subsection*{Problem 5a}
Suppose that $y-x>1$. Prove that there is an integer $k$ such that
$x<k<y$. Hint: let $l$ be the largest integer satisfying $l\leq x$, and
consider $l+1$.

\subsubsection*{Solution}

\subsection*{Problem 5b}
Suppose $x<y$. Prove that there is a rational number $r$ such that
$x<r<y$. Hint: if $1/n<y-x$, then $ny-nx>1$. (Query: Why have parts
(a) and (b) been postponed until this problem set?)

\subsubsection*{Solution}

\subsection*{Problem 5c}
Suppose $r<s$ are rational numbers. Prove that there is an irrational
number between $r$ and $s$. Hint: As a start, you know that there is
an irrational number between $0$ and $1$.

\subsubsection*{Solution}

\subsection*{Problem 5d}
Suppose that $x<y$. Prove that there is an irrational number between
$x$ and $y$. Hint: It is unnecessary to do any more work; this follows
from (b) and (c).

\subsubsection*{Solution}

\subsection*{Problems 6a, b}
A set $A$ of real numbers is said to be \textbf{dense} if every open
interval contains a point of $A$. For example, Problem 5 shows that
the set of rational numbers and the set of irrational numbers are each
dense.

\vs

(a) Prove that if $f$ is continuous and $f(x)=0$ for all numbers $x$
in a dense set $A$, then $f(x)=0$ for all $x$.

\vs

(b) Prove that if $f$ and $g$ are continous and $f(x)=g(x)$ for all
$x$ in a dense set $A$, then $f(x)=g(x)$ for all $x$.

\subsubsection*{Solution}

\subsection*{Problem 11a}
Suppose that $a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, \ldots$ is a sequence of positive
numbers with $a_{n+1}\leq a_{n}/2$. Prove that for any $\epsilon>0$ there is
some $n$ with $a_{n}<\epsilon$.
