\maketitle

I'm working through Spivak Calculus. Around the chapter on
epsilon-delta limits the details get pretty confusing. I started
supplementing with David Galvin's notes, which are considerabley more
clear but are still confusing. This is surprising because the topic
doesn't use anything beyond basic middle school math. Feels like it
should be simple! And so I'm attempting to write these notes to
properly understand the damned thing.
