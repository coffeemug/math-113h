\maketitle

I'm working through Spivak Calculus. Around the chapter on
epsilon-delta limits the details get pretty confusing. I started
supplementing with David Galvin's notes, which are considerabley more
clear but are still confusing. This is surprising because the topic
doesn't use anything beyond basic middle school math. Feels like it
should be simple! And so I'm attempting to write these notes to
properly understand the damned thing.

\vs

Spivak's chapters 7 (Three Hard Theorems) and 8 (Least Upper Bounds)
are swapped in these notes. Spivak first introduces the Intermediate
Value theorem and the Extreme Value theorem as facts, proves their
consequences, then introduces completeness and its consequences, and
finally proves IVT and EVT. I find it distracting and confusing. I
introduce completeness and its consequences first. I then introduce
and prove IVT and EVT, and cover their consequences. IMO this approach
is much less confusing than Spivak's.
