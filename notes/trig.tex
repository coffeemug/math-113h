\section{Trigonometric functions}

Spivak covers variations of trigonometric functions as he goes through
the book. I initially found it distracting-- it's hard enough to
understand $\epsilon-\delta$ limits; it's harder still if you're also trying to
learn trig as you go. But trig is important, and sooner or later it's
time to understand it. That time is now. Here I introduce the basics
of trigonometric functions, and then cover everything trig-related
from Spivak's early chapters that I ignored in these notes until now.

\subsection{Definitions}

Let $P$ be a point on a unit circle $x^2+y^2=1$. Let $\theta$ be the length
of the arc from $(1,0)$ to $P$, measured counterclockwise along the
circle. Then the coordinates of $P$ are
$(\cos\theta,\sin\theta)$.\footnote{The order is easy to remember-- it's
  alphabetical.}

\end{figure}

The measure of angles by the length of the arc is in units called
\textit{radians}. Recall the circumference of a circle is $C=2\pi r$,
and so the circumference of a unit circle is $2\pi$. Thus $\pi$ represents
a $180^\circ$ angle. Some common angles in radians are
$2\pi, \pi,\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{3}, \frac{\pi}{4}, \frac{\pi}{6}$, and
$\frac{3\pi}{2}$. To convert these to degrees simply replace $\pi$ with
$180$, and compute the fraction.

\vs

It should be self-evident that adding $2\pi$ to an angle results in the
angle itself; and that adding $\frac{\pi}{2}$ to an angle shifts it by
$90^{\circ}$. Further:
\[(\cos 0,\sin 0)=(1,0)\ \ \ \ \ \text{and}\ \ \ \ \ (\cos \frac{\pi}{2},\sin \frac{\pi}{2})=(0,1)\]

\subsubsection*{Plotting}
It is not too difficult to plot trigonometric functions. Consider some
properties of cosine we've already seen (or can easily deduce):
$\cos 0=1$, $\cos \frac{\pi}{2}=0$, $\cos \pi=-1$. We've also seen that
$\cos{(x+2\pi)}=\cos x$. The $x$-axis below covers $[-3\pi, 3\pi]$ (i.e. a
total length of $6\pi$). Since cosine repeats every $2\pi$, we should
expect the graph to repeat thrice. And this is exactly what we see.

\end{figure}

We can easily increase the frequency by plotting $y=\cos cx$. Here we
double the frequency with $c=2$:

\subsection{Limits}

\textbf{Claim 1a:} Let $f(x)=x\sin \frac{1}{x}$. Then
$\lim_{x\to0}f(x)=0$.

\textbf{Proof.} Let $\epsilon>0$ be given. We must show
$0<|x-0|<\delta$ implies $|f(x)-0|<\epsilon$. This is easy if you recall
the co-domain of $\sin$ is $[-1,1]$. This implies:
\[\left|x\sin \frac{1}{x}\right|\leq |x|\]

Thus fixing $|x|<\epsilon$ implies
$\left|x\sin \frac{1}{x}\right|<\epsilon$ as desired.



\vs---\vs

\textbf{Claim 1b:} Let $f(x)=x^2\sin \frac{1}{x}$. Then
$\lim_{x\to0}f(x)=0$.

\textbf{Proof.} By the same reasoning as above,
$\left|x^2\sin \frac{1}{x}\right|\leq x^2$. Thus fixing $|x|<\sqrt{\epsilon}$
implies $\left|x^2\sin \frac{1}{x}\right|<\epsilon$ as desired.

\vs---\vs

\textbf{Claim 1c:} Let $f(x)=\sqrt{|x|}\sin \frac{1}{x}$. Then
$\lim_{x\to0}f(x)=0$.

\textbf{Proof.} By the same reasoning as above,
$\left|\sqrt{|x|}\sin \frac{1}{x}\right|\leq \sqrt{|x|}$. Thus fixing
$|x|<\epsilon^2$ implies
$\left|\sqrt{|x|}\sin \frac{1}{x}\right|\leq \epsilon$ as desired.


\vs---\vs

\textbf{Claim 2:}\label{limits-claim-2} Let $f(x)=\sin \frac{1}{x}$.
Then $\lim_{x\to0}f(x)$ does not exist.

\textbf{Proof.} Let $\epsilon=\frac{1}{2}$. For any $\delta$ there exists
$x=\frac{1}{\pi/2+2\pi\cdot n}<\delta$. Observe that
$f(x)=1>\epsilon$. Thus $\lim_{x\to0}f(x)$ does not exist as desired.

\vs---\vs

\textbf{Claim 3:} Let $f(x)=\sin \frac{1}{x}=0$. Then
$\lim_{x\to\infty}f(x)=0$.

\textbf{Proof.} Spivak states this without proof. The crux is that
$|\sin t|<|t|$ for all real $t$ (which we cannot prove until $\sin$ is
defined later). But using this inequality the proof of the broader
claim is simple.

\vs

Let $\epsilon>0$ be given. We must show there exists $N$ such that for all
$x>N$, $|f(x)|<\epsilon$. Since
$\left|\sin \frac{1}{x}\right|<\left|\frac{1}{x}\right|$, it suffices
to ensure $\frac{1}{x}<\epsilon$, or $x>\frac{1}{\epsilon}$.

\subsection{Continuity}

\textbf{Claim 1:} $f(x)=\sin \frac{1}{x}$, $g(x)=x\sin \frac{1}{x}$
are not continuous at $0$.

\textbf{Proof.} Neither function is defined at $0$, and thus cannot be
continuous at $0$.

\vs---\vs

\textbf{Claim 2:} Let
\[G(x)=\begin{cases}
  x\sin \frac{1}{x},&x\neq0\\
  0,&x=0
\end{cases}\]
Then $G$ is continuous at $0$. 

\vs

\textbf{Proof.} This is easy. We saw that $\lim_{x\to0}x\sin
\frac{1}{x}=0$, and $G(0)=0$. Thus $\lim_{x\to0}x\sin
\frac{1}{x}=G(0)$, and thus $G$  is continuous at $0$.

\vs---\vs

\textbf{Claim 3:} $G$ is continuous at all $a$.

\textbf{Proof.} We already saw that $G$ is continuous at $0$ in claim
2. By using continuity theorems (and assuming $\sin$ is continuous),
it's easy to see $x\sin \frac{1}{x}$ is continuous for all $x\neq0$. Thus
$f$ is continuous for all $a$.

\vs---\vs

\textbf{Claim 4:} Let
\[F(x)=\begin{cases}
  \sin \frac{1}{x},&x\neq0\\
  a,&x=0
\end{cases}\]
Then $F$ is \textit{not} continuous at $0$, for any choice of $a$.

\vs

\textbf{Proof.} We saw that $\lim_{x\to0}x\sin \frac{1}{x}$ does not
exist, thus $F$ cannot be continuous at $0$.

\subsection{Derivatives}

\textbf{Claim 1:} Let
\[f(x)=\begin{cases}
  x\sin \frac{1}{x},&x\neq0\\
  0,&x=0
\end{cases}\]

Then $f$ is not differentiable at $0$.

\vs

\textbf{Proof.} Using derivative definition:
\[\lim_{h\to0}\frac{f(0+h)-f(0)}{h}=\lim_{h\to0}\frac{h\sin
    \frac{1}{h}-0}{h}=\lim_{h\to0}\sin \frac{1}{h}\]

We saw in \ref{limits-claim-2} that $\lim_{h\to0}\sin \frac{1}{h}$ does
not exist. Thus $f$ is not differentiable at zero.

\vs---\vs

\textbf{Claim 2:} Let
\[f(x)=\begin{cases}
  x^2\sin \frac{1}{x},&x\neq0\\
  0,&x=0
\end{cases}\]

Then $f$ is differentiable at $0$.

\vs

\textbf{Proof.} Using derivative definition:
\[\lim_{h\to0}\frac{f(0+h)-f(0)}{h}=\lim_{h\to0}\frac{h^2\sin
    \frac{1}{h}-0}{h}=\lim_{h\to0}h\sin \frac{1}{h}=0\]

Thus $f'(0)=0$.

\vs---\vs

\textbf{Claim 3:} Let
\[f(x)=\begin{cases}
  x^2\sin \frac{1}{x},&x\neq0\\
  0,&x=0
\end{cases}\]

Then $f'$ is not differentiable at $0$.

\vs

\textbf{Proof.} Observe that:
\[f'(x)=\begin{cases}
  2x\sin \frac{1}{x}-\cos \frac{1}{x},&x\neq0\\
  0,&x=0
\end{cases}\]

Observe that $\lim_{x\to0}\cos \frac{1}{x}$ does not exist (for the same
reason $\lim_{x\to0}\sin \frac{1}{x}$ does not exist). Thus
$\lim_{x\to0}f'(x)$ does not exist. And thus $f'$ is not continuous, let
alone differentiable at $0$.
